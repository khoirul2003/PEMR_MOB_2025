3. Explain the meaning of void async in practical 1.

async: The keyword async indicates that a function (in this case, main()) will run asynchronously. This means that the function can perform time-consuming operations (such as waiting for results from the camera) without blocking the application's main thread. In other words, the application remains responsive while the operation is in progress.
void: The return type void means that the function does not return any value.
So, Future<void> main() async means: The main() function is an asynchronous function that does not return a value (void). This function can perform operations that need to wait and will not make the application unresponsive.

4. Explain the functions of the @immutable and @override annotations.

@immutable:
This is an annotation used to mark a class as immutable. This means that once an instance of that class has been created, its state (the values of its instance variables) cannot be changed.

@override:
This is an annotation used to mark that a method within a class overrides a method with the same name from its parent class (superclass).
